# React Shopping Cart

Welcome to my React Shopping Cart application! This project is a SPA that allows users to browse products and add them to a cart for purchase. It also includes different routes to demonstrate the use of the react-router-dom library.

# Tech used

This project includes the following features:

- It was my first exposure to typescript which i liked a lot
- I used Tailwind for styling which is fast to write and easy to customize
- I used react-router-dom library to build a client side routing

# TODO

- i skipped the testing part as it seemed like a big chunk of work that im not ready to invest it just yet. Hopefully, in the near future i'll comeback to finish it because the testing is a crucial part of any app.
